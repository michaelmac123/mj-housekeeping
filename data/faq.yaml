  title: "Are you licensed and do you do background checks?"
  body: "MJ's is licensed by the State of Washington. We have posted the required bond, which assures that we are financially able to deliver the services we offer. All of MJ's independent contractors, as well as office staff, have undergone a Washington State Patrol background check. We will reimburse our clients up to $3000.00 if a housekeeper is convicted of a theft. We carry a liability insurance policy that covers any negligent act by MJ's and our staff. This policy does not cover the actions of the housekeepers, who are independent contractors and self-employed. We provide worker's compensation insurance. If they are injured while working in your home and you were not negligent, you will not be responsible for paying their medical bills or lost wages."

  title: "What is your cancellation policy? "
  body: "Contact us at least 48hrs+ prior to your scheduled day and time. Let us know if you are skipping service altogether or wish to reschedule. Our housekeepers rely on scheduled service (regular income) to pay the bills. The sooner we know you wish to cancel the easier it will be to provide the housekeeper with a fill-in client to replace that income. That being said, we are human, and understand when immediate emergencies happen, and you will not be charged in that situation."

Or, once you have met or let in your housekeeper, feel free to go about your day and leave them to take care of your home, perhaps with instructions to lock up when they are finished."

  title: "Should I tip my housekeeper?"
  body: "The housekeepers we work with are dependent on their regular income. They do deal with cancelations and rescheduling a bit differently than with other jobs. They are self-employed, and are at the mercy of the loss of hours from time to time, that are a result of cancelations and rescheduling. Tipping is something that can offset the loss of hours that housekeepers experience. They work very hard, and as with any other job in the service industry, they appreciate any tip that you feel they should receive. Our clientele typically tip anywhere from $5-$10.00 per service and up. Some of our clientele prefer to tip once a year, as a holiday/yearly bonus. If you would prefer not to tip, that is also your choice, and perfectly acceptable."

  title: "Can I leave my pets unattended in my home while my housekeeper is working?"
  body: "We do ask, for everyone's sake, that you secure your pets while your housekeeper is working. We want to protect your pet, and make them comfortable having someone in their home. We also want to protect them, as well as your housekeeper, from possibly injury â€“ pets sometimes get startled and can, and have, suddenly run in front of a housekeeper and caused them to trip, fall and hurt themselves. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule: some pets are elderly, or honestly require no securing. We ask that you use your best judgement and keep these things in mind."
